# Machine-Learning

In this e-tivity, we were asked to determine the components of a linear/non-linear programming problem, and then to implement in Python a program that will solve that problem by using the scipy.optimize library,how we determine the components of a linear/non-linear programming problem and also, how we implement linear/non-linear programs in Python. The program is implement is based on a real-life scenario, which is invented by module leader of this assignment and thus, the numbers provided are fictive.
